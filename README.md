BMP280 Barometric Pressure and Temperature sensor
==================================================


The Bosch BMP280 chip incorporates two sensors: a Barometric pressure sensor and an other one for temperature.
this cheap but accurate sensor is perfect for all weather applications thanks to the ± 1hPa / ± 1 ° C accuracy.
With the barometer, this sensor can also be used as an altimeter with an accuracy of ± 1 meter.
This sensor is also very versatile thanks to its I2C and SPI communication bus

Wiring and Test
-------------------
On the exemple include with BMP280 arduino library you can use 3 types of wiring: I2C, Hardware SPI or Software SPI with Arduino UNO or Arduino MEGA2560.
In this program you simply need to follow the 3 steps configuration, everything is explained.

Use the image below to wire your card for I2C use.
