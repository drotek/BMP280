The Bosh BMP280 chip incorporates two sensors: a Barometric pressure sensor and an other one for temperature.
this cheap but accurate sensor is perfect for all weather applications thanks to the 1hPa ± / ± 1 ° C accuracy.
With the barometer, this sensor can also be used as an altimeter with an accuracy of ± 1 meter.
This sensor is also very versatile thanks to its I2C and SPI communication bus
